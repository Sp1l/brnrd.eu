Summary: `mod_md` is by far the simplest way to add LetsEncrypt signed certificates to your Apache httpd server. Just add one line of configuration and you're done!

The Mozilla Open Source Support project commissioned Stefan Eissing (@icing) to create an integrated module for Apache's httpd server to make using TLS even easier. 
We already know Stefan Eissing as the creator of the HTTP/2 module for Apache httpd.

Even though issuing a certificate with `mod_md` is a breeze, the module itself not yet readily available for Apache version 2.4. It is already part of the upcoming Apache version 2.5.

***This is still an experimental module***<BR/>
It works for me, but your mileage may vary!<BR/>
*Full transparency*: I am the maintainer of the `www/mod_md-devel` port on FreeBSD

# Give me that mod_md module!

Since `mod_md` takes over the complete key and certificate directives, it needs integration with `mod_ssl`. What we need to do is add a patch to Apache httpd, rebuild and reinstall it before `mod_md` can issue and register certificates. [@icing's GitHub repo](https://github.com/icing/mod_md) hosts the required patches for `mod_ssl` as well (in the `patches` directory, doh!).

## Rebuild/install Apache httpd

With FreeBSD ports that would be done like this (make sure you get the most recent patch!):
```
cd /usr/ports/www/apache24
fetch -o files/patch-mod_ssl-for-mod_md https://github.com/icing/mod_md/raw/master/patches/mod_ssl_md-2.4.x-v4.diff
make clean package
pkg add -f work/pkg/apache24-2.4.27.tar.xz
```
or, in a more manual style, like so:
```
cd /usr/ports/www/apache24
fetch https://github.com/icing/mod_md/raw/master/patches/mod_ssl_md-2.4.x-v4.diff
make clean patch
cd work/httpd-2.4.27
patch -p0 < ../../mod_ssl_md-2.4.x-v4.diff
cd ../..
make clean package
pkg add -f work/pkg/apache24-2.4.27.tar.xz
```

## Build/install `mod_md`

With the patched Apache 2.4 installed, we can now build and install `mod_md`. 
The releases are ready-to-go tarballs that can easily be compiled. 
Check the [Latest Release](https://github.com/icing/mod_md/releases/latest) page to download the most current one.
```
fetch https://github.com/icing/mod_md/releases/download/v0.9.2/mod_md-0.9.2.tar.gz
tar xf mod_md-0.9.2.tar.gz
./configure --apxs=/usr/local/sbin/apxs
make && make install
```
The module can now be configured.

## Using FreeBSD ports

On FreeBSD this can be simplified, there's a `www/mod_md-devel` port that is ready for use.
First of all you'll have to rebuild apache with an extra patch.
To do so add to your `make.conf` (default location `/etc/make.conf`)
```
.if ${.CURDIR:M*/www/apache24}
EXTRA_PATCHES+=../mod_md-devel/files/extra-patch-mod_ssl
.endif
```
this will add the up-to-date patch to the apache build. 
Now rebuild/install `www/apache24`. 
This works in poudriere or other setups as well.

Now you can build the `www/mod_md-devel` port and install it.

# Using `mod_md`

To use `mod_md` you need disturbingly little configuration.
There's only 2 things you must do, the rest is optional.
First and foremost you ***must*** accept the terms of service of LetsEncrypt, secondly you add the domains that `mod_md` will manage.
```
MDCertificateAgreement https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.1.1-August-1-2016.pdf
ManagedDomains www.example.org
```
With all the other settings left as default, this will issue a certificate for the Virtual Host `ServerName www.example.org` with [Subject Alternative Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name) for all `ServerAlias`es.

## Tips

Your system will be registered with the `ServerAdmin` email address. This is where expiry notifications will be sent to.

By default, it will use 2048-bit keys and certificates.
This behaviour can be changed using
```
MDPrivateKeys RSA 4096
```
`mod_md` creates one (SAN) certificate for every ManagedDomain entry you have.
If you have multiple domains, you can steer the behaviour by adding multiple ManagedDomain directives
```
ManagedDomain www.example.org www.example.net
ManagedDomain www.example.com
```
would create 2 certificates (NB you need separate VirtualHost blocks to use them!).
