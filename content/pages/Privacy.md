Title: Your privacy
Date: 2016-12-11

I value my privacy and make conscious decisions on what I share and what I don't. I'd like you to have the same level of privacy that I'd like to have wherever I go.

1. This blog doesn't use cookies
2. There's no google- or other analytics embedded
3. All content is served over https with an up-to-date config
   a. With strong ciphers preferring [perfect forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy). 
   b. If you happen to arrive here via a plain http link you will be redirected to the https version. This may reveal the page you're visiting to people intercepting the traffic
4. Not even the HTTP referer [sic] is logged (this you can't check yourself so you'll have to trust me on this one)

If you find anything on this site that violates your privacy in __any__ way, do let me know! To my knowledge, all I have is my Apache logs. That means that I know your IP-address and the pages/resources you've visited.
