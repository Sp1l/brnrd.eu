# About brnrd | Bernard Spil | Sp1l | Barnerd

My name is Bernard Spil and my day-job is Solution Architect Enterprise Application Integration with additional engagements in infrastructure architecture, security architecture and enterprise architecture.	
I live in Heeze-Leende in The Netherlands (close to Eindhoven) and use multiple aliases. I alternate between 

 * Barnerd (IRC), 
 * Sp1l (GitHub, Twitter), 
 * brnrd (FreeBSD, this blog)
 * Bernard (my given name at birth).

In my free time I like to run, swim and cycle (not necessarily in that order) and tinker with computers, software and networks.

Besides that I have several volunteering engagements

  1. Core-team member [HSLnet](http://hslnet.nl) (local FttH cooperative)
  2. Contributor Bits-of-Freedom [Privacy Café](https://privacycafe.bof.nl/) (Dutch digital rights organization)
  3. [FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org) ports committer
    a. [PC-BSD](http://pcbsd.org) ports committer (LibreSSL fixes)
    b. [HardenedBSD](http://hardenedbsd.org) src committer (LibreSSL in base)

## FreeBSD

In the [FreeBSD](http://freebsd.org) Operating System project I am a mentored [ports](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/) committer. Currently I maintain the [LibreSSL](http://libressl.org) and [MariaDB](http://mariadb.org) ports.

Next to that I maintain a large number of patches that allow building projects with LibreSSL, which has some unsafe features removed, or allow building with an OpenSSL that was built with SSLv3 disabled.

## HSLnet

[HSLnet](http://hslnet.nl) is a not-for-profit cooperative that aims to connect all homes and businesses in the municipality of [Heeze-Leende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heeze-Leende).

Currently all of the homes within the 4 villages of Heeze, Leende, Sterksel and Leenderstrijp have a fiber connection or a bundle of cable buried underneath the pavewalk for later connection. Every home has 2 fibers, one for DVB-C-over-Fiber for the analog and digital TV signals, and one for the gigabit internet connection. The minimum plan is 100/100Mbps yet the providers are delivering 150/150Mbps as standard.

As a member of the core-team of HSLnet we advise the Board of Directors and the Members Council on technical and organizational topics.

## Privacy Café

[Privacy Café](https://privacycafe.bof.nl/) is an initiative of [Bits of Freedom](https://www.bof.nl/), a member of [European Digital Rights](https://edri.org/).

In a "Privacy Café" you can learn how to better protect your personal data as a means of digital self-defense. The meetings generally start with a presentation from one of the "stamgasten" and continues with hands-on sessions. People bring their laptops, phones and questions and a team of "stamgasten" helps them protect their privacy on
the internet.

# This blog

The blog is created using [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) which is a static page generator. I use the [w3-personal-blog](https://github.com/samael500/w3-personal-blog/) template which I've edited to suit my needs.

All in all I've found this very easy to use for a non-webdev like me!
